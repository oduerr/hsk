# CHANGELOG

## 5.10 - Refactor: Funnel All Core State Changes Through Actions

### Overview
Refactored the application to ensure all core state changes happen through explicit action functions, improving maintainability, consistency, and debuggability.

### New Actions Added

#### `updateSessionMetadata(name, id)`
- **Purpose**: Update session name and/or ID
- **State Changes**: `state.session.name`, `state.session.id`
- **Usage**: External modules updating session information
- **Replaces**: Direct `state.session.name =` and `state.session.id =` assignments

#### `setLevelLabel(label)`
- **Purpose**: Update the current vocabulary level label
- **State Changes**: `state.levelLabel`
- **Usage**: Vocabulary manager setting level information
- **Replaces**: Direct `state.levelLabel =` assignments

#### `removeAnnotation(cardId)`
- **Purpose**: Remove annotation from a specific card
- **State Changes**: `state.session.annotation`, `state.session.events`
- **Usage**: Clean up annotations when cards are removed
- **Replaces**: Direct annotation array filtering in main.js

### Refactored Modules

#### `js/vocabularyManager.js`
- **Before**: Directly mutated `state.levelLabel` and `state.session` properties
- **After**: Uses `setLevelLabel()` and `updateSessionMetadata()` actions
- **Benefits**: Consistent state management, proper action funneling

#### `js/main.js`
- **Before**: Directly filtered `state.session.annotation` and `state.session.events`
- **After**: Uses `removeAnnotation()` action
- **Benefits**: Centralized annotation removal logic, consistent event cleanup

### Documentation Created

#### `STATE.md`
- Comprehensive documentation of all state properties
- Clear distinction between core state (managed by actions) and UI-local state
- State mutation rules and guidelines
- Action function mappings for each state property

#### `ACTIONS.md`
- Complete documentation of all action functions
- State change mappings for each action
- Event logging specifications
- Usage examples and benefits

#### `js/actions.test.js`
- Lightweight test suite for action functions
- MockState-based testing approach
- Tests for state deltas and event logging
- Covers reveal, markMistake, nextCard, and markAnnotation actions

### State Mutation Rules Established

1. **Core state must only be modified through action functions**
2. **UI-local state may be modified directly**
3. **All state changes should be logged via events when appropriate**
4. **State mutations should be atomic and consistent**
5. **External modules should only read state, never write to it directly**

### Benefits Achieved

- **Consistency**: All state changes follow the same pattern
- **Maintainability**: State logic is centralized in actions
- **Debuggability**: Actions provide clear entry points for state changes
- **Replay**: Event logging enables session replay and analysis
- **Testing**: Actions can be tested independently with mock state

### Files Modified

- `js/state.js` - Added new action functions
- `js/vocabularyManager.js` - Updated to use actions instead of direct mutation
- `js/main.js` - Updated to use actions instead of direct mutation
- `STATE.md` - Created comprehensive state documentation
- `ACTIONS.md` - Created comprehensive action documentation
- `js/actions.test.js` - Created test suite for actions

### Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Grep/search shows no state writes outside action modules** (for core keys)
✅ **UI/event handlers call only actions/effects**
✅ **Names consistent and descriptive**
✅ **Core behavior unchanged**
✅ **Max files edited: ≤ 6** (6 files modified)
✅ **Max new actions: ≤ 8** (3 new actions added)

### Exception Handling

- **UI-local/transient state** (dialogs, hover, CSS toggles, temporary inputs) may still be mutated directly as intended
- **Configuration changes** (like `setAutoReveal`) don't log events as they're not user interactions
- **Session metadata updates** are handled through dedicated actions for external module use

This refactoring establishes a solid foundation for future state management improvements while maintaining all existing functionality.
